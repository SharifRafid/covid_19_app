    <string name="child_aware_heading">Parenting - How to stay positive</string>
    <string name="child_aware_body_1">It‚Äòs hard to feel positive when our kids or teenagers are driving us crazy.
        We often end up saying ‚ÄúStop doing that!‚Äù But children are much more likely to do
        what we ask if we give them positive instructions and lots of praise for what they
        do right.Say the behaviour you want to see. \n\n

        Use positive words when telling your child what to do; like ‚ÄòPlease put your clothes away‚Äô
        (instead of ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make a mess‚Äô\n\n

        Praise your child when they are behaving well\n
        Try praising your child or teenager for something they have done well.
        They may not show it, but you‚Äôll see them doing that good thing again.
        It will also reassure them that you notice and care.\n\n

        It‚Äôs all in the delivery\n
        Shouting at your child will just make you and them more stressed
        and angrier. Get your child‚Äôs attention by using their name.\n
        Speak in a calm voice.</string>

    <string name="child_aware_body_2">
        Get real\n
        Can your child actually do what you are asking them?
        It is very hard for a child to keep quiet inside for a
        whole day but maybe they can keep quiet for 15 minutes while you are on a call.\n\n

        Help your teen stay connected\n
        Teens especially need to be able to communicate with their friends.
        Help your teen connect through social media and other safe distancing ways.
        This is something you can do together, too!
    </string>

    <string name="parenting_stay_aware_heading">Parenting - Stay Aware </string>
    <string name="parenting_stay_aware_body_1">Create a flexible but consistent daily routine\n
        Make a schedule for you and your children that has time for structured activities as well as free time.
        This can help children feel more secure and better behaved.
        Children or teenagers can help plan the routine for the day ‚Äì
        like making a school timetable. Children will follow this better if they help to make it.
        Include exercise in each day  - this helps with stress and kids  with lots of energy at home.
        You are a model for your child‚Äôs behavior
        If you practice keeping safe distances and hygiene yourself, and treat others with compassion,
        especially those who are sick or vulnerable ‚Äì your children and teenagers will learn from you.
    </string>
    <string name="parenting_stay_aware_body_2">Teach your child about keeping safe distances\n
        If it is OK in your country,  get children outside.
        You can also write letters and draw pictures to share with people. Put them up
        outside your home for others to see!
        You can reassure your child by talking about how you are keeping safe. Listen to
        their suggestions and take them seriously.\n\n

        Make handwashing and hygiene fun\n
        Make a 20-second song for washing hands. Add  actions! Give children points and praise
        for regular handwashing.
        Make a game to see how few times we can touch our faces with a reward for the least number
        of touches (you can count for each other).\n\n

        At the end of each day, take a minute to think about the day.  Tell your child about one
        positive  or fun thing they did. Praise yourself for what you did well today.  You are a star!

        COVID-19 PARENTING\n\n

        Keep Calm and Manage Stress\n

        You are not alone\n

        Millions of people have the same fears as us. Find someone who you can talk to about
        how you are feeling. Listen to them. Avoid social media that makes you feel panicked.\n\n

        Take a break\n
        We all need a break sometimes. When your children are asleep, do something fun or relaxing
        for yourself. Make a list of healthy activities that YOU like to do. You deserve it!\n\n

        Listen to your kids\n
        Be open and listen to your children. Your children will look to you for support and reassurance.
        Listen to your children when they share how they are feeling. Accept how they feel and give them comfort.\n\n
</string>
    <string name="parenting_keep_calm_body_2">Take a Pause
        1-minute relaxation activity that you can do whenever you are feeling stressed or worried
        Step 1: Set up ‚Ä¢   Find a comfortable sitting position, your feet flat on the floor, your hands resting in your lap. ‚Ä¢  Close your eyes if you feel comfortable.
        Step 2: Think, feel, body ‚Ä¢  Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat am I thinking now?‚Äù ‚Ä¢   Notice your thoughts. Notice if they are negative or positive. ‚Ä¢   Notice how you feel emotionally. Notice if your feelings are happy or not. ‚Ä¢   Notice how your body feels. Notice anything that hurts or is tense.
        Step 3: Focus on your breath ‚Ä¢  Listen to your breath as it goes in and out. ‚Ä¢   You can put a hand on your stomach and feel it rise and fall with each breath. ‚Ä¢   You may want to say to yourself ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Whatever it is, I am okay.‚Äù ‚Ä¢  Then just listen to your breath for a while.
        Step 4: Coming back ‚Ä¢   Notice how your whole body feels. ‚Ä¢   Listen to the sounds in the room.
        Step 5: Reflecting ‚Ä¢  Think ‚Äòdo I feel different at all?‚Äô. ‚Ä¢   When you are ready, open your eyes.

        Taking a Pause can also be helpful when you find your child is irritating you or has done something wrong. It gives you a chance to be calmer. Even a few deep breaths or connecting with the feeling of the floor beneath can make a difference. You can also Take a Pause with your children!

        Talking about COVID-19\n
        Be willing to talk. They will already have heard something. Silence and secrets do not protect our children.

        Be open and listen\n
        Allow your child to talk freely. Ask them open questions and find out how much they already know.\n\n

        Heroes not bullies\n
        Explain that COVID-19 has nothing to do with the way someone looks, where they are from, or what language they speak.
        Tell your child that we can be compassionate to people who are sick and those who are caring for them.

    <string name="how_does_it_spread">"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.\n\nMost people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately.
